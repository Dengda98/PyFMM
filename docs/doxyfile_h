# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like "myfile.cpp" or
# directories like "/usr/src/myproject". Separate the files or directories
# with spaces.

INPUT = ../pyfmm/C_extension/include 

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the
# FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard patterns (like *.cpp
# and *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories. If left
# blank, Doxygen will consider all files in the directories.

FILE_PATTERNS = *.h

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute)
# base path where the generated documentation will be put.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = ./doxygen_h

# If the GENERATE_XML tag is set to YES Doxygen will generate an XML file
# that captures the structure of the code including all documentation.

GENERATE_XML = YES
